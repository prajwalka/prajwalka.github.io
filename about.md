<div class="about-me">
  <p>
    I grew up in Bengaluru, India, spending my first eighteen years there before moving to Mumbai for undergraduate studies. During this time, the summer research internships, my thesis work, and teaching assistantships lit the spark for pursuing a career in academia. Chasing that passion, I shifted to the United States for my graduate studies. The beginning was tough, with sleepless nights spent on learning new concepts and, of course, debugging. Over time, small wins followed the difficulties, the struggle turned into momentum, and momentum into joy. The PhD journey has instilled in me a never-give-up mindset, while also teaching a habit of celebrating the small moments in life. Following this, I have continued the journey as a postdoctoral researcher and aspire to become a faculty member. My life vision is to equip the next generation of researchers through my experiences and knowledge, and to elevate the fundamental understanding and modeling of materials to new levels of fidelity, performance, and impact, so that our work translates into meaningful benefit for society.

    Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for travel and have been fortunate to explore 17 countries across four continents. Some of my most memorable experiences include visiting Californiaâ€™s national parks and hiking through their stunning landscapes during my graduate studies. I also have a strong connection to music, having trained in Indian classical violin since childhood, which is a pursuit that continues to be my source of joy and grounding. In addition, I enjoy playing a variety of racquet sports and board games, and am an avid cricket follower. I find that music and spirituality have played a pivotal role in cultivating a sense of calm and a positive outlook, both in my research and in life more broadly.
