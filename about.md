<div class="about-me">
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Bengaluru, India, where I spent the first 18 years of my life before moving to Mumbai to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. During my undergraduate years, I had the invaluable opportunity to undertake summer research internships at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). These experiences sparked a deep interest in research and played a pivotal role in shaping my academic path. Motivated by this growing passion, I went on to pursue my master’s and doctoral studies at Stanford University—years that I fondly remember as transformative both personally and professionally. To further expand my research horizons, I am currently continuing my academic journey as a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University.

    Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for travel and have been fortunate to explore 17 countries across four continents. Some of my most memorable experiences include visiting California’s national parks and hiking through their stunning landscapes during my graduate studies. I also have a strong connection to music, having trained in Indian classical violin since childhood—a pursuit that continues to be a source of joy and grounding. In addition, I enjoy playing a variety of racquet sports and board games, and am an avid cricket follower. I find that music and spirituality have played a pivotal role in cultivating a sense of calm and a positive outlook, both in my research and in life more broadly.
