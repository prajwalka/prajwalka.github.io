  <div class="rd-content"> <p> The multi-institute collaboration project focuses on developing a digital twin ensuring Quality & Certification of Metal Additive Manufacturing processes and products. As part of the "multiscale modeling of properties, performance & life" cross-cutting cluster, I have been involved in developing micromechanical fatigue short crack growth models for additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 alloys. </p>
