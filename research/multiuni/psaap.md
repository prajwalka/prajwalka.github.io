  <div class="rd-content"> <p> The multi-institute collaboration project focused on developing a high-fidelity computational framework informed by microscale grain structure to predict the behavior of mock high-explosive materials. I was a part of the team evaluating the utility of continuum formulations in generalized continua to model experimentally observed macroscale fracture behavior of granular materials.  </p>

  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>Integrated contact formulation and incorporated heterogeneous material properties along with micropolar gradient damage approach to enhance modeling capacity for the heterogeneous granular materials</li>
    <li>Evaluated the utility of embedded finite element method (EFEM) in simulating their fracture behavior</li>
