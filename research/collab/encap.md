  <div class="rd-content"> <p> I was part of the project that focused on developing a framework for strain analysis of a stretchable transistor array comprising substrate and encapsulant layers to accurately predict the local strain within the encapsulant layer based on globally applied strains across various design configurations. This study is crucial for optimally designing stretchable transistor arrays used in wearable electronics applications.  </p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>Developed a framework for predicting the local strains on the encapsulant layer of stretchable transistors </li>
    <li>Modeled the precise geometry, boundary conditions, and material behavior of each layer</li>
    <li>Achieved high accuracy when compared with the experimental observations for different substrate thicknesses and transistor densities</li>
