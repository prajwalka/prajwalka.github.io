  <div class="rd-content"> <p> We utilized physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve inverse problems, where deformations are reconstructed from strain sensor readings. This study holds significant promise for shape-sensing applications such as structural health monitoring and shape reconstruction in the medical and fashion industries. </p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>Accounted for the underlying physics, represented by governing equations and boundary conditions, in the neural network framework, while also minimizing discrepancies with the sensor data. </li>
    <li>Validated the model by comparing with true solutions using the finite element method and achieved great accuracy with even a small number of sensor data</li>
