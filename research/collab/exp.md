  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>Fabricated dogbone specimens of PDMS rubbers to obtain the uniaxial tensile response in order to calibrate material parameters </li>
    <li>Fabricated square films with a central hole and asymmetric notches to study the fracture behavior due to these geometrical features of different sizes</li>
    <li>Utilized the data to validate our multiscale fracture models and achieved great accuracy</li>
  </ol>
