  <div class="rd-content"> <p> As polycrystalline metallic alloys are widely used in industry, scalable computational models are essential for large-scale simulations. Because their fatigue life spans thousands of loading cycles, the models must estimate behavior over long time scales. We are currently developing methods to enable this capability. </p>
