  <div class="rd-content"> <p> Polycrystalline materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys are of high commercial importance due to their use in critical components across the automotive, aerospace, marine, and biomedical industries. This is attributed to their exceptional properties, including high specific strength, fatigue resistance, and corrosion resistance at service temperatures. The mechanical behavior of these materials strongly depends on their underlying crystal microstructure. Since fatigue life is a key parameter for industrial applications, my current research focuses on developing micromechanical models that can accurately predict fatigue behavior while remaining computationally efficient for large-scale simulations. </p>


  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>State-of-the-art model for predicting fatigue short crack growth behavior in polycrystalline metallic alloys</li>
    <li> Accounts for microstructure physics like dislocation motion and entanglement effects, tension-compression asymmetry, and crystallographic morphological effects</li>
    <li>Validated with experimental data obtained through collaboration, with less than 10% error in complex polycrystalline microstructures</li>
  </ol>
