  <div class="rd-content"> <p> Rubber-like materials find widespread applications in areas like stretchable electronics, self-actuators, implantable sensors, and many engineering fields. This is primarily due to their desirable attributes, such as high stretchability, high toughness, low modulus, and low cost. Consequently, accurately modeling their fracture behavior becomes crucial for comprehending and designing them resiliently against failures. Notably, certain materials like natural rubber stand out for their superior qualities compared to their counterparts. Numerous efforts have been made to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind its exceptional properties, with strain-induced crystallization (SIC) emerging as a key phenomenon believed to enhance fracture resistance. Moreover, SIC is also observed in polymer melts during industrial processing, where it can be harnessed to tailor the properties of finished products. Motivated by these insights, this study focused on developing a multiscale model coupled with the phase field approach to model crack propagation in these strain-crystallizing materials. </p>


  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ol class="rd-highlights">
    <li>First multiscale model to model the effects of crystallite evolution in delaying the fracture initiation and propagation of strain-crystallizing rubbers</li>
    <li>Accounts for microscale polymer chain physics like the entropy of the chains, molecular bond stretching, crystallite interface energy, microscale anisotropy in polymer network response, rupture of molecular bonds, and distortion of crystallites</li>
    <li>Validated the model by comparing the simulation predictions with experimental studies in literature</li>
