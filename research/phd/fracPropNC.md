  <div class="rd-content"> <p> Rubber-like materials find widespread applications in areas like stretchable electronics, self-actuators, implantable sensors, and many engineering fields. This is primarily due to their desirable attributes, such as high stretchability, high toughness, low modulus, and low cost. Consequently, accurately modeling their fracture behavior becomes crucial for comprehending and designing them resiliently against failures. However, the challenges posed by their multiscale nature, microscale anisotropy in polymer network response, and incompressible behavior make precise modeling of their fracture behavior a formidable task. Motivated by these insights, this study focused on developing a multiscale model coupled with the phase field approach to model crack propagation in general non-crystallizing rubbers. </p>
