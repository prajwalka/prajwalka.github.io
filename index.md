      Hello! I am Prajwal Kammardi Arunachala. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Somnath Ghosh in the [Computational Mechanics Research Laboratory (CMRL)](https://cmrl.jhu.edu/) working on the   and my research focuses on microstructure-informed computational mechanics.
      Here, I aim to bridge the gap between material microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical behavior through innovative computational approaches.
