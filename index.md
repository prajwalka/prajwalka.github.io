      Hello! I am Prajwal Kammardi Arunachala. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Somnath Ghosh in the <a href="https://cmrl.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Mechanics Research Laboratory (CMRL</a>, working on modeling the fatigue behavior of polycrystalline materials like titanium and aluminum alloys.  and my research focuses on microstructure-informed computational mechanics.
      Here, I aim to bridge the gap between material microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical behavior through innovative computational approaches.
