      Hello! I am Prajwal Kammardi Arunachala. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University working with Dr. Somnath Ghosh in the <a href="https://cmrl.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Mechanics Research Laboratory (CMRL)</a>, working on modeling the fatigue behavior of polycrystalline materials like titanium and aluminum alloys. During my PhD, I worked under Dr. Christian Linder at Stanford University in the <a href="https://cm2.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Mechanics of Materials (CM2) Laboratory</a>, working on modeling the fracture and my research focuses on microstructure-informed computational mechanics.
      Here, I aim to bridge the gap between material microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical behavior through innovative computational approaches.
